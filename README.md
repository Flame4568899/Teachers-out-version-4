# Teacher Voting System

A simple teacher voting system where users can vote for their favorite teachers. Once a vote is submitted, the teacher is removed from the list of options until the next day.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Choose a teacher from the dropdown and submit your vote.
3. The voted teacher will appear under the "Voted Teachers" section and be removed from the dropdown list.

### Next Steps:
- Add backend support to track votes and reset voting options at 8 AM every day.
- Implement user-specific vote restrictions.
